-------
This code has been created to complete a challenge to create an Takeaway system to meet the user stories given.

I have aimed to solve this challenge using the BDD cycle, with a test driven approach.

I have included feature tests within the file - whilst I am aware these repeat some code, I have added individual tests for clarity at this stage in my progression. Also as unit tests isolated, similar feature tests implemented to confirm expected integration behaviour between classes.

## User stories
-----

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
